# stale_policy (G-022)

Config key `stale_policy`: `behind_ok` (default) or `strict`. Set with `factory config stale_policy strict` (rollback).

With `behind_ok`, a PR whose head does not contain `origin/main` ("BEHIND") is not refreshed when **all** hold:

- GitHub's branch protection of `main` reads `required_status_checks.strict == false`. It is read live with
  `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/branches/main/protection` and cached 10 minutes (config key `stale_strict:<owner/repo>`).
  `strict == true`, no protection or any read failure behaves as `strict`.
- GitHub reports `mergeable == MERGEABLE` (no conflict). A conflicting or unknown PR is refreshed or sent back as before.

Effects:

- `factory judge --merge` no longer refuses with `STALE-ONLY`; every other check (verdict head-binding, CI/local gate,
  public-text guard, noreply author, push policy, `--match-head-commit`) is unchanged. The judge verdict reason gets
  `merged behind main by stale_policy=behind_ok (strict=false on GitHub)`.
- The reviewer, qa and judge spawn pre-check skips `refresh_branch` for such a PR.
- `judge_pr_ready` treats BEHIND as ready.

Backstop: push CI on main, the red-main freeze (T-0623, not yet wired: TODO in `cmd_judge`) and the fix-or-revert task.
